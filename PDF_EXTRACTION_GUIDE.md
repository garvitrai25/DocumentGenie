# PDF Text Extraction Guide

## What Was Fixed

The PDF text extraction has been improved to extract actual document content instead of placeholder text. The AI can now analyze the real content of your PDF files.

## How It Works Now

1. **Primary Extraction**: Uses pdf-parse with optimized settings to extract text from text-based PDFs
2. **Fallback Method**: If primary extraction fails, tries alternative parsing options
3. **Clear Error Messages**: Provides specific feedback for different types of PDF issues

## Supported PDF Types

✅ **Text-based PDFs** - PDFs with selectable text (created from Word, Google Docs, etc.)
✅ **Form PDFs** - PDFs with fillable fields and text content
✅ **Mixed content** - PDFs with both text and images

⚠️ **Limited Support**:
- **Scanned PDFs** - Image-only PDFs require OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
- **Password-protected PDFs** - Need to be unlocked first
- **Heavily formatted PDFs** - May have extraction issues

## Testing Your PDF

To test if your PDF will work well:

1. **Upload a text-based PDF** (like a Word document saved as PDF)
2. **Wait for processing** - Status will show "Processing" then "Processed"
3. **Start a chat** - Ask the AI about specific content
4. **Verify extraction** - The AI should reference actual document content

## If PDF Extraction Fails

If you see messages like "Unable to extract text" or "appears to contain images":

1. **Try a different PDF** - Use a text-based document
2. **Convert scanned PDFs** - Use OCR software first
3. **Use TXT files** - Upload plain text files as an alternative
4. **Check PDF corruption** - Re-save or re-export the PDF

## Best Practices

- **Use text-based PDFs** when possible
- **Test with simple documents** first
- **Check document status** before starting chat
- **Upload TXT files** for guaranteed text extraction

Your AI document analysis platform now provides much better PDF content extraction!
